VaxEase

Our open-source vaccination software is designed to streamline the process of scheduling, administering, and tracking vaccinations. It features an easy-to-use interface that allows medical staff to schedule appointments, check-in patients, administer vaccines, update patient information, and generate reports. The software also includes inventory management tools to help track vaccine stocks and expiration dates.

Our software is built using open-source technologies and can be easily integrated with existing electronic medical record systems. It is designed to be flexible and customizable, so it can be adapted to meet the unique needs of any vaccination program.

Our goal is to provide a cost-effective and efficient solution that can help improve vaccination rates and protect public health. We encourage the community to contribute and help us improve the software. We welcome pull request and issues to make our software better for everyone.

- Vaccines administration
- Appointment (add new appointment, view appointment history)
- A mobile app for managers (to monitor the progress of the vaccination progress) and for general public (to view history and certificate)
